# Personal Portfolio

First and foremost, a big thank you to the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/). I used `create-t3-app` for the
initialization of this application and it has saved me so much time trying to get setup with the latest and greatest
ESLint and TypeScript configurations, allowing me to focus on the content.

## About the Project

This project is my personal website that I will be using for the forseeable future. Some technologies here are on the
bleeding edge, chosen for exploration, while others are battle tested. Regardless of the technology utilized, I aim to
provide a seamless user experience with a focus on performance, accessibility, and security... with a twist of course.

## Tech Stack

- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Framework**: Next.js (React)
- **Runtime / Package Manager**: Bun

## Getting Started

If you're keen on diving deeper into the code or setting it up on your own machine, follow these steps:

1. First, ensure you have Bun installed. If not, grab it from [here](https://bun.sh/).

```bash
# Install Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

2. Once Bun is ready, you can set up the project:

```bash
# CD into the project directory
cd personal-website

# Install the necessary packages
bun install

# Start the development server
bun dev
```
